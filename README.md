# My "Magic the Gathering" decks - 2021+

After 12 years without playing Magic the Gathering, I started to play again after arriving in Strasbourg in August 2021... and I'm loving it!

There are in the `.cod` format accepted by [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/), the awesome free and open-source software to play Magic the Gathering alone or with other online.
You can freely download and import any of the decks directly in Cockatrice.

Note that most of the decks are work in progress, as I experiment with them and try to optimize them, before ordering them on [CardMarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/).
In particular, the sideboards of most decks are incomplete.
