# My "Magic the Gathering" deck lists - 2021+

After 12 years without playing Magic the Gathering (I stopped in 2009), I started to play again after arriving in Strasbourg in August 2021... and I'm loving it!

*NOTE:* I also use [MoxField](https://www.moxfield.com/users/Naereen) pour tenir mes decks liste, uniquement pour celles que je peux construire en vrai.

This small git repository contains the list of some Magic decks, most of which I don't own physically. Some I do.

There are in the `.cod` format accepted by [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/), the awesome free and open-source software to play Magic the Gathering alone or with others online.

You can freely download and import any of the decks directly in Cockatrice. If you do and enjoy one of this deck, feel free to contact me!

Note that most of the decks are work in progress, as I experiment with them and try to optimize them, before ordering some of them on [CardMarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/).

In particular, the sideboards of most decks are incomplete, or even empty, and can surely be improved easily!
